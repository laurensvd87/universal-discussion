# Project status

Updated: 2026-09-28. Active direction: ADR-014/015/016 and the product-first roadmap.
Previous detailed chronology is preserved in
[the historical status](archive/STATUS_2026-09-25.md).

## Where we are

We have a tested local resolver/metadata prototype, not yet a discussion app.
The core product hypotheses—semantic concentration, personal AI utility and
community adoption—remain unvalidated. Stop expanding review infrastructure;
build the local discussion loop and early related-source/embedding utility.

| Capability | Actual state |
| --- | --- |
| Exact URL/fingerprint resolution | Implemented on synthetic fixtures; not semantic similarity |
| Chromium URL lookup | Bundled example.com/example.org mappings only |
| Metadata capture | Controlled loopback fixture and one pinned MDN route only; explicit button, no body/egress/storage |
| Review/evaluation tooling | Implemented mechanics; no real larger corpus or held-out model results |
| Synthetic owner review | Finished: 6/6. Do not repeat |
| Related-page discovery | Offline ranker and extension 0.4.0 demo implemented; six synthetic Sources, hand-authored vectors, no current-tab input or web search |
| Discussions and replies | Service domain/API implemented for local human roots/replies/edit/withdraw; no extension UI |
| Local persistence | Memory and SQLite adapters implemented; app-owned database ignored; no client persistence |
| Current-tab auto-load | Not implemented; belongs to approved S3 client integration |
| Learned embeddings/general same-Topic matching | Not implemented; early R2 model experiment before R5 AUTO validation |
| AI handoff/import/provider | Planned; no inference or real credentials |
| Local backend | S1/S2 core, SQLite and in-process `/v1` handler implemented; no listener/client activation |
| Real accounts/mobile/hosting/stores | Not implemented, deployed or submitted |

## Reassessment completed 2026-09-27–28

- Audited code against documentation and ran the current suites. Preserved
  completed experiment evidence without claiming product readiness.
- Recorded provider-neutral matching without a crawler, content-kind-aware
  Topic granularity, optional local embeddings and user-confirmed associations.
- Researched official AI-host connectors and manual handoff for subscription
  users without API keys. No provider integration or subscription proxy built.
- Corrected mobile policy requirements: personal user blocking, reports and
  moderated public UGC; selected private AI-output reporting without broad
  moderator access. Qualified retention, account-rights and appeal claims.
- Replaced the per-module approval sequence with a bounded local envelope and
  explicit meaningful external/data gates. Preserved old records as history.
- Implemented metadata lifecycle invalidation for the post-attestation same-URL
  reload race. Pending and resolved snapshots clear on source-tab changes;
  listeners are removed on reset/retry/disposal. No new permissions or capture.
  Code commit: `f8947a2`.

Research: `research/PRODUCT_RESET_2026-09-27.md` and
`research/PRODUCT_RESET_POLICY_2026-09-27.md`. Decision: ADR-014.

## Related-source increment completed 2026-09-28

- Owner accepted personal utility before community volume and proposed related
  pages as a standalone reason to use the app. ADR-015 prioritizes early real
  embeddings and source discovery alongside R1; no fake populated forum.
- Implemented a bounded browser-neutral candidate ranker, deterministic duplicate
  handling and strict model/dimension compatibility. Similarity never assigns a
  Topic. Existing same-Topic associations and related reading render separately.
- Added an English message pack and an isolated zero-post demo panel. Six bundled
  synthetic Sources have explicitly hand-authored vectors, not learned embeddings.
  No source-tab observation, network, storage or additional permission enters it.
- Researched provider-independent known-source ranking, ordinary-search handoff,
  Brave/Exa pricing and reuse restrictions, and Common Crawl tradeoffs. No provider
  selected; no API request, download, paid account or external integration made.
- Follow-up research covers recurring Brave/Tavily/Parallel free allowances and
  on-visit background lookup feasibility. Neither a provider nor passive browsing
  observation is approved or activated by the owner's feasibility question.
- Updated only generated unit-test digest snapshots for the expanded provenance
  manifest. The actual owner ledger and its completed 6/6 task are untouched.

Evidence: `research/RELATED_PAGE_DISCOVERY_2026-09-28.md`; ADR-015.

## Service-first orchestration completed 2026-09-28

- Owner deferred external search and requested a cheaper-model implementation
  handoff with explicit return-to-GPT-6-Astra checkpoints.
- Owner requested embeddings, linked pages and application state on a local
  server now to simplify later hosting. ADR-016 supersedes the canonical
  extension IndexedDB plan: one Node service, replaceable repository/embedding
  adapters, SQLite locally, versioned API and a thin extension client.
- [IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF](IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md) froze the now-completed S1/S2 block:
  pure domain/catalog, memory/SQLite repository and secured in-process handler.
  No listener, new extension permission, model asset or real input is activated.
- The first stop is Astra review and explicit owner approval of the exact
  loopback/pairing/permissions/payload/retention package before S3 integration.
  Later model, data, provider and deployment gates remain explicit. Returning to
  Astra is a review checkpoint, never a substitute for owner approval.
- Checked Node 24.19.0 and an in-memory `node:sqlite` probe (SQLite 3.53.3).
  No disk database or socket was created. The built-in module has release-candidate
  stability; the adapter isolates it and hosting requires revalidation.

The orchestration-only baseline was `9e48916`; S1 was committed as `324163e`.

## Local-service S1/S2 completed 2026-09-28

- Added `apps/local-service` with no external dependencies. Its pure domain owns
  separate Sources, confirmed Source links, Topics, Discussions and Contributions.
  The catalog reuses six project-created fixtures and the existing pure ranker;
  vectors remain labelled hand-authored demo coordinates, not learned embeddings.
- Implemented create Topic, human root/reply/edit/withdraw, grouped deterministic
  views, ownership checks, revision purge on withdrawal, synthetic actor registry,
  resource bounds and generation/revision compare-and-swap. Related suggestions
  never create Topic links; API DTOs expose neither vectors nor similarity scores.
- Added interchangeable memory and built-in `node:sqlite` repositories. SQLite
  uses prepared statements, transactions and one bounded `demo-state/v1` record.
  Reopen, concurrent stale writes, rollback, reset, unknown schema, malformed and
  structurally manipulated state are covered. Logical deletion is not claimed as
  forensic erasure; unknown/corrupt databases are never silently overwritten.
- Added a transport-neutral `/v1` handler and dormant composition point. Exact
  Host and bearer are mandatory; supplied Origin must match, preflight is narrow,
  request/response shapes and sizes are bounded, errors are generic, and arbitrary
  URL/path/model/provider operations do not exist. The handler was tested only
  in-process under the existing socket/DNS/fetch/subprocess denial harness.
- No HTTP server implementation or `.listen()` call exists. `test:integration`
  is an intentional failing approval gate. No extension file/permission, real
  page input, model asset, external request or disk database in the repository
  was added. The current stop is Astra/Trust review plus explicit ADR-016 owner
  approval before any S3 listener/client integration.

## Verification and residuals

Documentation-only service handoff checks (2026-09-28):

- `git diff --check` passes; all 37 local Markdown links across 16 changed/new
  documents resolve. No product test rerun is claimed for this documentation change.
- Separate AI Trust/Quality review returns qualified ACCEPT after correcting
  missing-Origin handling and requiring the existing network-denial harness for
  service tests. ADR-016, handoff and active documents agree on placement and gates.
  This accepts the plan, not service security, durability, browser interoperability,
  learned matching or store readiness. The later implementation evidence follows.

S1/S2 implementation checks (2026-09-28):

- Local service `npm test`: 28/28 pass under the external-capability denial harness.
- Local service `npm run check:secrets`: 22 files, zero findings, six scanner self-tests.
- Existing spike `npm test`: 294 total, 293 pass and one expected restricted-only skip.
- Existing spike `npm run test:restricted`: 294/294 pass.
- Existing spike `npm run indicator:test`: 112/112 pass.
- Existing spike `npm run check:secrets`: 101 files, zero findings, six self-tests.
- Syntax checks pass for every local-service JavaScript file; `git diff --check`
  passes. No loopback integration or browser smoke was run because S3 is gated.

2026-09-28 post-discovery-increment checks:

- `npm test`: 294 tests, 293 pass, one expected restricted-harness-only skip.
- `npm run test:restricted`: 294/294 pass.
- `npm run indicator:test`: 112/112 pass (overlaps the full suite).
- `npm run check:secrets`: 101 package files, zero findings, six scanner self-tests.
- Separate AI Trust/Quality review accepts the bounded navigation correction.
  This is not independent-human, legal or store approval.
- Separate AI Trust/Quality review accepts the isolated related-page demo after
  correcting the stale synthetic digest expectations. No live discovery or
  learned-embedding usefulness is claimed. Real-browser panel smoke is pending.
- Cross-document review found a conflicting blanket ban on private-draft
  persistence. It is corrected: local demo drafts may persist as scoped, while
  credentials and automatically captured source context may not. Active links
  and local/external approval boundaries were checked; the reviewer verified
  the correction and returned qualified ACCEPT with no remaining doc blocker.
- Follow-up ADR-015/current-document review accepts the implemented/planned
  distinctions and retained gates; all 23 checked local Markdown links resolve.

The new lifecycle wiring has automated mocked-browser/race coverage, but no
fresh real-Chromium smoke yet. Earlier owner smoke remains complete for its old
version; it does not cover this change. Event delivery is asynchronous, not an
atomic guarantee of DOM freshness; any source-tab update conservatively clears
the metadata and may require retry. The MDN experiment expires on 2026-10-23.

## Next work and authority

R0 reassessment/hardening and documentation reconciliation are complete.
R2's first fixture-only related-source increment and R1 handoff S1/S2 are complete.
Stop now for GPT-6 Astra review of the implementation and Trust boundary. Before
binding the listener or enabling client networking/storage, ask the owner for the
exact ADR-016 activation package; do not continue into S3 on prior local authority.
Synthetic identity is a testing device, not real login/security isolation.

Before binding the listener or enabling extension networking/storage permissions,
stop for Astra review and ask explicitly for ADR-016's activation package. After
approved S3 and its browser smoke, review the first real embedding experiment;
model acquisition/activation and broader real-page capture remain separate exact
fields/contexts/permissions/assets/retention gates. R1 stores no captured browsing
data. External search is deferred, not a blocker for these steps.
Provider/data egress, real accounts/testers, deployment, purchases, public posts,
recruitment and store submission each retain explicit applicable approvals.

The 200–250-pair provenance-approved review is deferred to R5. Stop and ask before
acquisition/review becomes required; give the owner a concrete assignment for an
independent person then. No independent person is needed for the next local code
increment. Completed synthetic labeling is not real-world accuracy evidence.

## Important decision status

- ADR-014: active sequencing and local engineering envelope.
- ADR-015: related pages as first-user utility, early embeddings, provider-neutral
  discovery with explicit coverage/rights/cost limits; no provider activated.
- ADR-016: active local-service-first architecture and S1/S2 handoff; exact
  listener/client activation awaits owner approval. Supersedes IndexedDB placement.
- ADR-001/004: frozen baseline/editorial evaluation evidence; unchanged.
- ADR-009: local-first NO-AUTO direction retained and made executable.
- ADR-010/011: existing exact URL/metadata boundaries unchanged by this reset.
- ADR-012: prior design retained with policy corrections; exhaustive lifecycle
  features are phased with actual capabilities, not all prerequisites for R1.
- ADR-013: sensitive body-derived matching remains separately gated; local
  transformation does not establish anonymity, website rights or store approval.
- ADR-003/005: backend/correction candidates, not deployed infrastructure or
  permission for global merges.

No real data acquisition, new provider call, model download, spending,
deployment, announcement, store submission or public discussion occurred.
